# Dependency Update Status

## Current Status: ✅ OFFLINE-ONLY BUILD

This repository has been converted to an offline-only build. All Google and Firebase SDKs and related deployment tooling have been removed or disabled. Only local, offline dependencies remain.

### Notes
- Keystore and signing configuration are preserved for release builds.
- Generated build artifacts and plugin symlinks referencing Firebase/Google were removed and will be regenerated by the Flutter tool without those plugins when you run a fresh build.

### Recommendation
- Continue development and run `flutter pub get` and `flutter build` on your machine to regenerate platform files without Firebase. Keep backups of any CI/CD credentials that referenced Google services if you still need them elsewhere.

### Current Priority:
**OFFLINE STABILITY** > Firebase integration

This file was updated to reflect the project’s offline-first configuration.
