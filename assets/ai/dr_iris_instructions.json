    "response": "I understand you're feeling anxious. Let's start with a simple breathing technique: breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, and exhale for 6. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and helps calm your mind."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["depressed", "depression", "sad", "down", "low mood"],
    "response": "Depression can feel overwhelming, but small steps make a difference. Try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique: notice 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["panic", "panic attack", "can't breathe"],
    "response": "You're experiencing intense feelings, but you're safe right now. Try the STOP technique: Stop what you're doing, Take a breath, Observe your surroundings, and Proceed mindfully. Focus on your exhale being longer than your inhale."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["stress", "stressed", "overwhelmed", "too much"],
    "response": "When everything feels like too much, break it down into smaller pieces. Write down just 3 things you need to do today. Complete one at a time. Remember: you don't have to carry everything at once."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["lonely", "alone", "isolated", "no friends"],
    "response": "Loneliness is painful, but it's temporary. Start with small connections: smile at a neighbor, text one person, or join one online community. Even tiny interactions plant seeds for bigger connections."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["angry", "furious", "rage", "mad"],
    "response": "Anger often signals that something important to you is being threatened. Try the TIPP technique: change your Temperature (cold water on face), do Intense exercise for 5 minutes, use Paced breathing, or try Progressive muscle relaxation."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["sleep", "insomnia", "can't sleep", "tired"],
    "response": "Sleep struggles affect everything. Create a wind-down routine: no screens 1 hour before bed, try the 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8), and keep your bedroom cool and dark. If your mind races, write worries on paper first."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["relationship", "partner", "boyfriend", "girlfriend", "marriage"],
    "response": "Relationships need both connection and space to breathe. Try the HALT check: are you Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired? Address these first, then communicate using 'I feel' statements rather than 'you always/never' language."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["work", "job", "career", "boss", "workplace"],
    "response": "Work stress can consume your whole life if you let it. Set clear boundaries: define your work hours, take actual lunch breaks, and practice the 'good enough' rule - not everything needs to be perfect."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["family", "parents", "siblings", "relatives"],
    "response": "Family relationships are complex because they're loaded with history. You can love someone and still need boundaries. Practice the gray rock method for difficult family members: be boring, brief, and non-reactive."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["trauma", "ptsd", "flashback", "triggered"],
    "response": "Trauma lives in your body, not just your mind. When triggered, try grounding: press your feet firmly on the floor, hold an ice cube, or name 5 things you can see around you. Remind yourself: 'That was then, this is now. I am safe.'"
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["suicide", "suicidal", "end it all", "kill myself"],
    "response": "These thoughts are signs of deep pain, not weakness. You matter, and this feeling will pass. Call a crisis helpline immediately: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 988. Create a safety plan with someone you trust. You deserve support right now."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["self-harm", "cutting", "hurt myself"],
    "response": "Self-harm often helps regulate intense emotions, but there are safer alternatives. Try holding ice cubes, drawing red lines on your skin, intense exercise, or screaming into a pillow. Your pain is real and deserves attention, not more pain."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["eating", "food", "weight", "body image", "fat", "thin"],
    "response": "Your relationship with food reflects your relationship with yourself. Try intuitive eating: eat when hungry, stop when satisfied, and notice how different foods make you feel. Your worth isn't measured by numbers on a scale."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["addiction", "drugs", "alcohol", "drinking", "substance"],
    "response": "Addiction is often self-medication for deeper pain. Recovery happens one moment at a time. Use the HALT check regularly, find healthy dopamine sources (exercise, music, connection), and remember: relapse doesn't erase progress."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["perfectionism", "perfectionist", "not good enough", "failure"],
    "response": "Perfectionism is fear wearing a mask of high standards. Try the 80% rule: most things only need to be 80% perfect to be effective. Progress beats perfection every single time."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["procrastination", "lazy", "can't start", "postponing"],
    "response": "Procrastination is often perfectionism or fear in disguise. Use the 2-minute rule: if something takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. For bigger tasks, commit to just 10 minutes. Starting is usually the hardest part."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["confidence", "self-esteem", "insecure", "not worthy"],
    "response": "Confidence isn't about feeling fearless; it's about acting despite the fear. Keep a daily wins journal - write down 3 things you did well each day, no matter how small. Your inner critic isn't your truth."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["boundaries", "saying no", "people pleaser", "can't refuse"],
    "response": "Boundaries aren't walls; they're gates with you as the gatekeeper. Start small: say 'let me think about it' instead of automatic yes. Remember: saying no to others means saying yes to yourself."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["money", "financial", "debt", "broke", "poor"],
    "response": "Financial stress affects mental health deeply. Start with what you can control: track spending for one week, identify one unnecessary expense to cut, and focus on progress, not perfection. Your value isn't your net worth."
  },

  },
  {
    "keywords": ["grief", "loss", "death", "died", "mourning"],
    "response": "Grief has no timeline or 'right way' to process. Allow yourself to feel everything: anger, sadness, even moments of joy. Create rituals to honor your loss. Healing doesn't mean forgetting; it means learning to carry love alongside the pain."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["change", "transition", "moving", "new job", "life changes"],
    "response": "Change is the only constant, but that doesn't make it easier. Focus on what stays the same during transitions - your values, strengths, and support system. Take change in small bites, not huge swallows."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["motivation", "unmotivated", "no energy", "don't care"],
    "response": "Motivation is like a muscle - it needs exercise to grow stronger. Start with tiny actions: make your bed, drink a glass of water, walk for 5 minutes. Action creates motivation more than motivation creates action."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["jealousy", "envious", "comparing", "others have more"],
    "response": "Comparison steals joy and creates a rigged game where you'll always lose. Practice gratitude daily: write down 3 specific things you're thankful for. Remember: social media shows highlight reels, not reality."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["forgiveness", "can't forgive", "betrayed", "hurt by someone"],
    "response": "Forgiveness is for you, not them. It doesn't mean what they did was okay; it means you're choosing freedom over resentment. Start by forgiving yourself for being human, then work outward."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["purpose", "meaning", "pointless", "what's the point"],
    "response": "Purpose doesn't have to be grandiose. It can be as simple as making one person smile each day. Ask yourself: what small difference can I make right where I am? Meaning is created through action, not found through thinking."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["aging", "getting old", "youth", "time running out"],

  },
  {
    "keywords": ["technology", "social media", "phone addiction", "screen time"],
    "response": "Technology should serve you, not the other way around. Set phone-free zones and times. Use the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Real connection happens offline too."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["weather", "seasonal", "winter blues", "SAD"],
    "response": "Seasonal changes affect your brain chemistry. Get morning sunlight exposure, maintain regular sleep schedules, and consider a light therapy lamp for winter months. Your body is responding normally to environmental changes."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["crying", "can't stop crying", "tears", "emotional"],
    "response": "Crying is your body's natural stress release system. Let the tears flow without judgment - they're healing, not weakness. After crying, drink water and do something gentle for yourself. Emotions are temporary visitors, not permanent residents."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["hope", "hopeless", "no hope", "giving up"],
    "response": "Hopelessness is depression's biggest lie. When you can't see the forest for the trees, focus on just the next step forward. Hope is built through small actions, not grand gestures. You've survived 100% of your difficult days so far."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["control", "controlling", "can't control", "micromanage"],
    "response": "The only thing you can truly control is your response to what happens. Use the circle of control: inside are your actions, thoughts, and choices. Outside are other people, weather, and outcomes. Focus your energy inside the circle."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["trust", "can't trust", "betrayal", "suspicious"],
    "response": "Trust is rebuilt slowly, brick by brick. Start by trusting yourself to handle whatever comes your way. Trust others based on consistent actions over time, not just words. It's okay to trust partially until someone proves themselves fully."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["fear", "scared", "afraid", "frightened"],
    "response": "Fear often signals something important is at stake. Ask yourself: is this fear protecting me from real danger, or is it just trying to keep me small? Feel the fear, name it, then take one small brave step anyway."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["shame", "ashamed", "embarrassed", "humiliated"],
    "response": "Shame says 'I am bad' while guilt says 'I did something bad.' Shame thrives in secrecy and silence. Share your shame with someone safe - you'll often find it loses its power when exposed to compassion."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["criticism", "judged", "people talking", "what others think"],
    "response": "Other people's opinions of you are none of your business. Those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind. Focus on the feedback from people whose opinions you actually value and respect."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["patience", "impatient", "waiting", "slow progress"],
    "response": "Patience is a skill you can develop, not just a personality trait. When impatient, take three deep breaths and ask: 'What can I learn while I wait?' Progress often happens invisibly before you see visible results."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["expectations", "disappointed", "let down", "expected more"],
    "response": "Expectations are premeditated resentments. Hold your plans lightly and your values firmly. When disappointed, grieve what you hoped for, then ask: 'What opportunity might this disappointment be revealing?'"
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["success", "failure", "achievement", "goals"],
    "response": "Success isn't a destination; it's a practice. Redefine success as growth, not just outcomes. Every 'failure' contains information for your next attempt. You're not behind; you're exactly where you need to be."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["creativity", "creative block", "inspiration", "artistic"],
    "response": "Creativity flourishes with constraints, not complete freedom. Set a timer for 15 minutes and create something - anything. Perfectionism kills creativity; play nurtures it. Your unique perspective is your creative superpower."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["exercise", "fitness", "workout", "physical activity"],
    "response": "Exercise is medicine for both body and mind. Start where you are: walk for 10 minutes, do 5 push-ups, stretch for 3 minutes. Movement doesn't have to be perfect or intense to be beneficial. Something is always better than nothing."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["meditation", "mindfulness", "present moment", "awareness"],
    "response": "Mindfulness isn't about emptying your mind; it's about noticing what's in it without judgment. Start with 3 minutes daily. When your mind wanders (and it will), gently return attention to your breath. This gentle return IS the practice."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["habit", "routine", "consistency", "discipline"],
    "response": "Habits are built through repetition, not perfection. Start ridiculously small: one push-up, one page read, one minute of meditation. Make it so easy you can't say no. Consistency beats intensity every time."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["decision", "choices", "can't decide", "indecisive"],
    "response": "Decision paralysis often stems from perfectionism. Most decisions are reversible. Use the 10-10-10 rule: How will I feel about this decision in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years? Trust your gut after you've informed your head."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["learning", "studying", "education", "knowledge"],
    "response": "Learning is a lifelong adventure, not a destination. Embrace beginner's mind - being bad at something is the first step to being good at it. Focus on progress over perfection, and celebrate small wins along the way."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["communication", "talking", "expressing", "conversation"],
    "response": "Good communication is more about listening than talking. Use the WAIT principle: Why Am I Talking? Seek to understand before seeking to be understood. Your goal is connection, not being right."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["time management", "busy", "no time", "overwhelmed"],
    "response": "You have the same 24 hours as everyone else. The issue isn't time management; it's priority management. List your tasks, then ask: 'What would happen if I didn't do this?' Focus on important, not just urgent."
  },

    "keywords": ["gratitude", "thankful", "appreciation", "blessed"],
    "response": "Gratitude is a practice that rewires your brain for positivity. Write down 3 specific things you're grateful for each morning. Focus on why you're grateful, not just what. Gratitude turns what you have into enough."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["adventure", "exploration", "new experiences", "curiosity"],
    "response": "Life begins at the end of your comfort zone. Start with micro-adventures: try a new food, take a different route home, talk to a stranger. Curiosity is courage in disguise. Your comfort zone will expand if you gently push its boundaries."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["nature", "outdoors", "environment", "natural"],
    "response": "Nature is medicine for the soul. Even 10 minutes outside can shift your perspective. If you can't get outside, bring nature in: plants, natural light, nature sounds. You're part of the natural world, not separate from it."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["spirituality", "faith", "religion", "meaning"],
    "response": "Spirituality is about connection - to something larger than yourself, whether that's God, universe, humanity, or nature. It's deeply personal. Find practices that fill you with peace, wonder, or gratitude."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["community", "belonging", "connection", "tribe"],

  },
  {
    "keywords": ["legacy", "impact", "contribution", "making a difference"],
    "response": "Your legacy isn't what you achieve; it's how you make others feel and grow. Small acts of kindness ripple outward in ways you'll never know. You're already making a difference by being authentically you."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["energy", "tired", "exhausted", "drained"],
    "response": "Energy management is more important than time management. Notice what gives you energy vs. what drains it. Protect your energy like the finite resource it is. Rest isn't earned; it's required for sustainable living."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["focus", "concentration", "attention", "distracted"],
    "response": "Focus is a muscle that gets stronger with practice. Start with single-tasking: do one thing at a time with full attention. Remove distractions before starting important work. Your attention is your most valuable currency."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["passion", "purpose", "calling", "what I love"],
    "response": "Passion isn't always found; it's often developed through engagement and mastery. Follow your curiosity, not just your passion. Ask: 'What problems do I enjoy solving?' Your purpose might be right in front of you."
  },

    "keywords": ["resilience", "bounce back", "recovery", "strength"],
    "response": "Resilience isn't about being unbreakable; it's about knowing how to put yourself back together. Build your resilience toolkit: good friends, healthy habits, coping strategies, and self-compassion. You're stronger than you know."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["vulnerability", "opening up", "sharing feelings", "being real"],
    "response": "Vulnerability is courage, not weakness. It's the birthplace of connection, creativity, and change. Start small: share something real with someone safe. Your authenticity gives others permission to be authentic too."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["independence", "autonomy", "self-reliance", "on my own"],
    "response": "True independence includes knowing when to ask for help. Self-reliance doesn't mean isolation. Balance independence with interdependence - we all need each other sometimes, and that's not weakness."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["growth", "development", "improvement", "getting better"],
    "response": "Growth happens in the spaces between your comfort zone and panic zone. Be patient with your process. You're not the same person you were a year ago, even if the changes feel invisible. Keep showing up for yourself."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["balance", "work-life balance", "equilibrium", "harmony"],
    "response": "Balance isn't a perfect split; it's about being present wherever you are. Some seasons require more work, others more rest. Listen to what your life needs right now, not what others expect from you."
  },
  {
    "keywords": ["wisdom", "learning from experience", "insight", "understanding"],

  },
  {
    "keywords": ["intuition", "gut feeling", "inner voice", "instinct"],
