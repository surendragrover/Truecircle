# Language Preference

Important:

- App UI language: English. All on-screen labels, buttons and messages must be in English.
- Use Hindi only for conversational messages between the developer and the owner (not in the app UI or assets shown to users).
- If a technical tool or external dependency requires English-only text (e.g. error messages), include the necessary English text and optionally add a short developer note in repository docs.

Thank you — this preference is recorded so the app remains English-first.
